# event-center-website


Hello World! Welcome to my Event Center Website! 


Hi Team, so for this project the objective was to create an event center website for a venue that will host different events.
As for me personally outside of Tech - I love sports, music and fashion so I decided to go with the the concept of a venue that 
will host all of the above. A unique feature about this concept is the option for customers to host their own personal events at the venue
or ordering catering to offsite events. 

I started this project by designing a mockup of layout on Figma then developing the structure of the website using the proper HTML elements including text, images, tables, and a form for collecting customer's info. After ensuring the required elements were in place, I used CSS to style the webpage's elements like colors, fonts, adjusted spacing and added other effects to make the user expereience more interactive. 

How to run the program: 
You can access the website in your preferred web browser! =
